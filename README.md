## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Complete the form and see a success toast message upon successful submission.
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A required field has been missed.
  - The email address is not formatted correctly.
- Complete the form only using their keyboard.
- Have inputs, error messages, and the success message announced on their screen reader.
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size.
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

Working on this project reinforced the importance of accessibility and user experience in form design. I learned how to create custom validation messages and implement a success toast notification after form submission.

### Continued development

In the future, I plan to:

- Improve the accessibility of the form by adding ARIA attributes.
- Refactor the JavaScript code to make it more modular and reusable.
- Explore more advanced validation techniques, such as real-time validation.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - MDN's documentation on form validation was incredibly helpful in understanding how to implement custom validation messages.
- [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/) - A great resource for CSS techniques that helped me with styling the form.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Add ARIA attributes for enhanced accessibility.
- [ ] Implement real-time validation for form inputs.
- [ ] Create unit tests for the form validation functions.
- [ ] Explore the use of a JavaScript framework like React for state management.
- [ ] Add animations for form transitions and error messages.
